1
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.400
I saw the father and the nun today at the church.

2
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Well, I've done this often.

3
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.100
I love the kids here.

4
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.940
If I have a baby
I should raise him in a place like this.

5
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.540
...because here we have
wildflowers and trees to see.

6
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.230
And it's close to Seoul.

7
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.410
Uh? Tow truck?

8
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.210
They said it might take a while to get here.

9
00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.820
hmm, I love hearing your voice now.

10
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.050
Since I can hear your voice and it's snowing,

11
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.330
the ambiance in my car has livened up.

12
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.580
Just a second.

13
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.920
Does your tire have an air leak?

14
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.100
Yes, I called a tow truck.

15
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.020
It'll take a long time to get here since it's snowing.

16
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.490
Let me check your tire.

17
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.470
He said he would check the tire.

18
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.070
Really?

19
00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.620
I think you should just wait for the tow truck.

20
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.320
Huh? No, it's not hard to
change a tire.

21
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.500
Hmm? It's strange.

22
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.070
You told him you called the tow truck but the guy wants to check your tire.

23
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.720
Wait, wait.

24
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.200
What's the status?

25
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.380
Okay.

26
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.880
Hello? Joo-yeon, I think I should head out now.

27
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.850
Don't open the car door and just wait for
the tow truck.

28
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.420
Huh?

29
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.940
Wait.

30
00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.970
"My love...

31
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.630
so sweet...

32
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.290
I just..."

33
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.410
I, I just don't like him checking the tire
even though you told him you called the tow truck.

34
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.380
...Well, there are people around here.

35
00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.320
Ha...I'm sorry, I couldn't be with you for your birthday.

36
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.470
Okay. I'll be there soon.

37
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.350
Um.

38
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:19.740
Your car's completely sunk.

39
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.890
Thank you for your help but I think I should just wait for the tow truck.

40
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.480
Thank you so much.

41
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.300
Why isn't he leaving?

42
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:32.230
I Saw the Devil

43
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.620
Mister... Mister... Mister...

44
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.520
It's going to be easy since your skin is so soft.

45
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.530
Can you please not kill me?

46
00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.160
Why?

47
00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.440
I...

48
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.800
have a baby in my belly.

49
00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.330
Spare my life, please.

50
00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.250
Dong-soo! Dong-soo!

51
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.050
What?

52
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.690
Come over here! Hurry Up!

53
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.530
Detective! Why did you come out here?

54
00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.830
We can let you know the situation later if you stay at home.

55
00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.040
What happened? What happened to my daughter?

56
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.560
Don't look. Not now.

57
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.210
We don't know yet.

58
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.640
Detective Joh.

59
00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:34.830
Here.

60
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.030
Is this...?

61
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.980
Let me see.

62
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.300
It looks like hair. Flip it over.

63
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.070
Forensics team!

64
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:16.740
Here, here! Come here, hurry!

65
00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:20.120
We found it--we found it over here.

66
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.830
...God helped us.

67
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:12.670
Otherwise we wouldn't have been able to find her.

68
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.020
It's funny how the father couldn't protect his own daughter,

69
00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:28.030
even though he has been a detective in charge of violent crime for over 30 years.

70
00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:40.090
...Please stop smoking sir.

71
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.750
I'm sorry.

72
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:58.890
I'm really sorry.

73
00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:11.600
To you and to my Joo-yeon.

74
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.500
I am terribly sorry.

75
00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:51.750
I'm sorry, Joo-yeon.

76
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.160
I couldn't keep the promise.

77
00:21:56.650 --> 00:22:01.540
I was late and couldn't keep the promise.

78
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.310
But Joo-yeon,

79
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.360
I'll promise this:

80
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:20.560
I'll give him pain that's a thousand times--

81
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.420
no--ten thousand times worse.

82
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.820
Soo-hyun.

83
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:17.880
So, how long do you want?

84
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.970
Since there's nothing urgent to do, you can rest for a few months.

85
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.580
Two weeks is enough.

86
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.140
You can rest longer.

87
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.010
No, I'll come back to work after two weeks.

88
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:33.420
Well, I really appreciate it if you can do that.

89
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.260
But are you going to be okay?

90
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.890
...Alright.

91
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:50.310
Then I'll be expecting you in two weeks.

92
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.130
In the meantime, please rest yourself fully.

93
00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.950
I can't believe this happened to us.

94
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.300
They just got engaged less than a month ago.

95
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.520
What a crazy world.

96
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.710
You're here.

97
00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:26.500
Here's the GPS,

98
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.050
and the capsule.

99
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.150
There's a GPS and a voice mic inside here.

100
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:32.670
Isn't it marvelous?

101
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:39.080
Good job.

102
00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.420
Thank you.

103
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.870
You're welcome.

104
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.430
Aren't you going in?

105
00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:50.220
Yes?

106
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.340
Isn't there anything to say?

107
00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.220
No.

108
00:24:56.270 --> 00:25:02.560
Well, I trust you
but if there's going to be any problem,

109
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.180
we could get into serious trouble
since I siphoned them off from another division.

110
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.430
Don't worry.

111
00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.360
I'll make sure there's no problem.

112
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:31.300
The police suspect those four.

113
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:37.350
They were the suspects when there were similar cases before.

114
00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.200
Soo-hyun, you're here.

115
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:43.700
Yeah.

116
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.860
Do you want to have supper?

117
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.030
No, I have to leave now.

118
00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.960
I went grocery shopping for dad.

119
00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:57.760
I'll get going now.

120
00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.460
Don't see me off outside.

121
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.030
Are you leaving?

122
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.110
Yes.

123
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.860
Why isn't this bastard moving a single muscle?

124
00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.920
Yes.

125
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.390
There's no suspicious movement yet.

126
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.640
Yes.

127
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.070
Yes sir.

128
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.840
This guy's the dirtiest pervert, I swear.

129
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:10.470
Quiet.

130
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.560
Do you remember this?

131
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.240
You really don't know?

132
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.050
I see.

133
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.390
Who the fuck is he?

134
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:49.700
Why does he look so bruised up?

135
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:51.140
Why's he turning himself in?

136
00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.350
Two months ago, there was a dead teenage girl's body
in Bang-Ho river--he said he did that girl.

137
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.560
He confessed that the missing Shin-Chun high school girl
a few years ago was his job too.

138
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.980
What the hell is wrong with him?

139
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:03.230
Why does he have so many bruises?

140
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:05.120
Who did this? Did you guys do it?

141
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:12.400
No. All of a sudden paramedics came and went upstairs and found him almost dead like this.

142
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.650
Then who did this? He injured himself?

143
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.780
He didn't explain that part yet.

144
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:20.140
What the--hey, what happened to you last night?

145
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.680
What the hell is he saying?

146
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:35.250
It sounds like some guy hit his penis with a hammer badly.

147
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.590
Ahh, that's nonsense.

148
00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:42.130
Hey retard, who hit your penis?

149
00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:13.180
Who the fuck are you?

150
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.350
Hey you motherfucker!

151
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:20.110
There're no more buses at this time of day.

152
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.120
Where are you going?

153
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.890
Pardon me?

154
00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.850
I said, where are you going?

155
00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.270
Sungmin apartment.

156
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.700
Sungmin?

157
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.060
Since it's not too far from here, I can give you a ride.

158
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.230
I can take you there.

159
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.690
No thanks.

160
00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.480
I can take you there.

161
00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:41.910
It's okay.

162
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.240
Sungmin apartment is very close to here.

163
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.220
It's okay.

164
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:03.490
Are you sure?

165
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.140
Yeah, it's okay.

166
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.750
Get in the car.

167
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.790
What?

168
00:34:29.050 --> 00:34:31.930
Yes? Nothing.

169
00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.890
Is this an after-school academic bus?

170
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:06.050
Where did I leave it?

171
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.040
What?

172
00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:43.920
Yes?

173
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.330
Why are you looking so scared?

174
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:51.350
Haven't you seen this before?

175
00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.620
Who are you?

176
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.300
By the way, why do you need these to get the insurance money?

177
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.610
First of all, I need to make sure that your son
is my policyholder, Jang Gyeong-chul,

178
00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:37.850
since there are many people with the same name.

179
00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:41.400
These are all old pictures.

180
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:55.630
Maybe you can recognize him in this picture.

181
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:02.720
I'll ask a few more questions.

182
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:07.910
Is there any other way to contact him now?

183
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:12.010
I don't know, but his son might know how to contact him.

184
00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.220
Sang-hoon! Sang-hoon!

185
00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:18.510
Where is he?

186
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:27.010
Yangpyeong? Chungpyeong? I think.

187
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.390
Lastly, I want to make sure your son is the one that I'm looking for.

188
00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.690
Is this Jang Gyeong-chul?

189
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:46.750
He's Gyeong-chul.

190
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:52.320
Was this picture taken recently?

191
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:59.510
How come he looks so scary here?

192
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:02.060
Insurance my ass.

193
00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:07.410
He insured the family?

194
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.010
He left us, and his son, and never came back!

195
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.930
Now you think he has an insurance policy on our names?

196
00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.810
That's nonsense!

197
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:18.850
Why are you saying that?

198
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:23.370
Am I wrong? Do you still think he's our son?

199
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:27.890
He's good for nothing!

200
00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:31.080
Please shut your mouth and snap out of it.

201
00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.790
Why are you saying that?

202
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:35.290
It's not appropriate to say stuff like that.

203
00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.090
Fuck, whatever.

204
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.150
By the way, if the policyholder is dead or missing,

205
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.810
does his family get the money?

206
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:19.710
Are you Sang-hoon?

207
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:28.410
Do you know where your father lives now?

208
00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:37.370
Shit. Why do you ask?

209
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.870
You guys don't go anywhere but home now, alright?

210
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:08.950
Yes.

211
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.290
Driver, please don't let them out anywhere else.

212
00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.090
Yeah.

213
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:17.370
Thank you.

214
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.170
Who are you?

215
00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:05.240
Is Jang Gyeong-chul here?

216
00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.000
Why do you ask that?

217
00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.860
We're police. Where is he?

218
00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.280
He's driving our kids to their homes now.

219
00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.780
Can you call him right now? Please?

220
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:04.550
What? One girl is missing?

221
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:06.590
What were you guys doing?

222
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.450
How come you guys didn't notice Jang Gyeong-chul leaving the house?

223
00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:10.400
You guys were asleep while staking out, right?

224
00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:12.540
How come you guys missed him?

225
00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:16.020
You're reporting back to me that shit happens?

226
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.860
You guys were all at the front of the house, right?

227
00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:19.310
What were you guys doing there?

228
00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.700
Did you guys plan to catch him after greeting him?

229
00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.410
What a bunch of retards.

230
00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:23.500
Now listen.

231
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:27.840
We need to watch every corner of the after-school academy and we must find Jang Gyeong-chul first.

232
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:29.540
We don't need a fucking warrant.

233
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.020
We just gotta catch him, got it?

234
00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.440
Mark my words: he is the murderer.

235
00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.460
Go catch him!

236
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.260
It's me.

237
00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.410
I just got home to get changed but I don't think I have enough time to get changed now.

238
00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.480
So...where are you going?

239
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:50.440
To my friend's place.

240
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:51.250
Friend? Who?

241
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:52.530
Do you know any of my friends?

242
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:53.190
What?

243
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.590
Do you just want to take the clothes or do you want to get changed now?

244
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.710
No, I don't have time.

245
00:46:56.850 --> 00:46:57.730
Just give me the clothes.

246
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.710
No, I wasn't talking to you.

247
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.750
Why are you going to a friend's place at this time?

248
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:02.080
To study!

249
00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:04.110
Why are you studying at your friend's place?

250
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.590
Why are you nagging me now?

251
00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.930
Are you talking back to me? Come over here!

252
00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:10.770
No!

253
00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:12.220
Look at this girl!

254
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:15.340
What are you doing now? Hurry up and go.

255
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.140
Let me see.

256
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.950
Ah...your skin is so pale.

257
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:41.730
It's okay, it's okay.

258
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:44.350
I'll finish it real quick.

259
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.040
It looks like I can't fucking drive the academic bus anymore.

260
00:48:54.570 --> 00:48:56.230
...Things are getting fucking twisted now.

261
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:06.540
But shit, can't I like you?

262
00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:10.450
I can like you, right?

263
00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:14.040
It's totally okay that I like you.

264
00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:19.330
Then why the fuck is the whole world giving me so much shit, huh?

265
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:21.530
Why is that?

266
00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:37.020
I'll finish it real quick.

267
00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:55.380
Jang Gyeong-chul.

268
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.370
What? Are you alone?

269
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:52.880
Are you a cop?

270
00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:09.280
I see, you're a cop.

271
00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.540
How come the Korean police found me so quickly?

272
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.140
I'm so surprised.

273
00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:29.400
I guess you still don't know who I am now.

274
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.500
Well, what do I expect from the Korean police?

275
00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:38.240
That's that.

276
00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:29.590
You shithead!

277
00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.980
Fuck you!

278
00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.690
What, what the hell is this guy?

279
00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:07.590
This guy's a fucking psycho.

280
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:06.490
Fucking asshole.

281
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:52.480
Hello, sir!

282
00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:57.030
I don't know where you're headed,
but you can take this taxi.

283
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:59.300
Aren't you getting in?

284
00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:01.090
There're no more taxis at this time.

285
00:59:04.690 --> 00:59:07.890
How come you decided to walk this road alone?

286
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:13.910
Well, you're lucky that you got a taxi here.

287
00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:17.400
The customer in the back seat is heading in the same direction.

288
00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:19.300
You're okay going with this gentleman, right?

289
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.140
Sure.

290
00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.500
Anyway, it must've been really hard for you to catch a taxi.

291
00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.170
You can hardly see a taxi around here at this time.

292
00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.790
I rarely even drive here.

293
00:59:47.210 --> 00:59:49.770
Only once in a while, I come here for work.

294
00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:54.390
But you gentlemen are so lucky today.

295
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:57.030
You know that?

296
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:03.310
Recently, there've been so many bad incidents
around this area that I can't get any customers here.

297
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:07.530
But today I have two customers here.

298
01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:11.720
Come to think of it, I'm also lucky today!

299
01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:13.510
Ain't I, sir?

300
01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.690
Where were you gentlemen going from such a dark place?

301
01:00:38.830 --> 01:00:43.680
Sir? Did something good happen to you today, sir?

302
01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.010
Mister.

303
01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:46.410
Yes?

304
01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.900
You said we're all lucky today.

305
01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.120
That's what I said.

306
01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:58.730
Why?

307
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.740
But I think you're so unlucky today.

308
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.780
Crazy retards.

309
01:04:12.590 --> 01:04:14.650
Your bones will be attached soon since you're young.

310
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:16.940
Don't worry about it.

311
01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:22.890
How did you break your wrist playing soccer?

312
01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.340
Did you play with your fists?

313
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:30.660
Anyway, from now on take it slowly. Got it?

314
01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:38.060
It's done.

315
01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.920
You can leave.

316
01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:45.460
Hey, you motherfucker.

317
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.650
Am I your son?

318
01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:56.560
Then why do you talk down to me?

319
01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:03.960
Take off your glasses.

320
01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.080
Take off your glasses.

321
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:15.820
Come here.

322
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:18.100
Come over here.

323
01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:22.200
Sir? You can come outside now.

324
01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:24.380
You need to take the prescription.

325
01:05:34.310 --> 01:05:35.600
How old are you?

326
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:40.750
I'm 22.

327
01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.020
Must be nice being 22.

328
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.590
Boyfriend?

329
01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:47.650
Pardon me?

330
01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:53.140
You look like you have many boyfriends. Right?

331
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.100
No. I don't have a boyfriend.

332
01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.840
Don't fucking lie to me.

333
01:06:03.050 --> 01:06:06.270
How come a cutie like you don't have a boyfriend?

334
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.780
You don't know about 'IT.'

335
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:16.050
Excuse me?

336
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.630
If you don't know about 'IT,'
then you can hardly know about men.

337
01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:44.900
Yesterday I was going to have some fun,
but some asshole spoiled everything.

338
01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.360
So this time I want to go smoothly with you.

339
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.810
Take off your clothes.

340
01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.450
Huh?

341
01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:35.110
Take off your clothes, yourself.

342
01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:39.650
Since we're going to do it, you should enjoy it too, right?

343
01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.210
So take off your clothes.

344
01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:06.670
Take them off before I put scars on your face
with my knife, bitch.

345
01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:14.840
I said, take them off quickly, you bitch.

346
01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.460
That's right.

347
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:19.430
Take off your bra too. Hurry up.

348
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.230
Please don't kill me.

349
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.000
That's it. Take off your skirt too.

350
01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:26.760
You son of a bitch.

351
01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:31.070
Who the hell are you, you fucking bitch.

352
01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.870
Wait.

353
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:30.140
Don't leave now.

354
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.140
I need to treat you immediately.

355
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:36.700
Why are you pretending to be so weak?

356
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.450
It's just the beginning.

357
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:43.190
Remember this.

358
01:13:44.450 --> 01:13:46.200
It's going to be even more terrible.

359
01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:54.790
Close your eyes now.

360
01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:56.490
Turn around, and cover your ears too.

361
01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:03.750
Hey fuck you, crazy ass motherfucker, shit!

362
01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.020
Ha! Son of a bitch!

363
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.650
You want to do this against me, huh?

364
01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.680
Hey, you son of a bitch! You really want to do this?!

365
01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.780
Crazy motherfucker.

366
01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:25.370
Alright, you fucking shithead, let's see who's the top dog here.

367
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.900
What is it?

368
01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:45.910
Has there been an accident?

369
01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.370
Looks like something's wrong with the car.

370
01:19:14.700 --> 01:19:16.080
Yes, sir.

371
01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.880
Is everything okay with you?

372
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:27.750
I'm just worried about you.

373
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:34.390
The police think that I'm after Jang Gyeong-chul.

374
01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.050
It seems like they're also after Jang Gyeong-chul.

375
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:44.890
So I was wondering....

376
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:51.500
if you can stop chasing him now.

377
01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.850
But I...

378
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:54.970
You've done enough.

379
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.060
I want you to stop it.

380
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.220
But, sir...

381
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:13.990
never mind.

382
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:16.790
I see. I'll hang up.

383
01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:21.380
Soo-hyun, it's me.

384
01:20:23.300 --> 01:20:24.590
Soo-hyun.

385
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:27.540
Yeah, how are you doing?

386
01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.910
How are you doing, Soo-hyun?

387
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.130
I'm just busy with my work now.

388
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:37.490
Really? What kind of work?

389
01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.710
You know what I do.

390
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:45.120
I know what you do normally, but I don't know what you do secretly.

391
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:47.570
You got the criminal's information from my dad already?

392
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.650
Soo-hyun, I understand how you feel, but I want you to stop it.

393
01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.990
My sister won't come back, even if you do this.

394
01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:07.210
Even if you catch him, nothing changes.

395
01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:13.770
Revenge is something people do in a movie,
but this man is just crazy.

396
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:18.650
I'm sorry, but I have nothing to tell you.

397
01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.010
What do you mean you have nothing to tell me?

398
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:24.320
Am I nobody to you?

399
01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.080
Do you know how I have been lately?

400
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:33.900
Recently, I started checking back a lot
to see if anyone's following me.

401
01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.280
Now you tell me you have nothing to tell me?

402
01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:48.840
So I beg you now.

403
01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.340
There's no meaning. Please stop it.

404
01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.510
I'm sorry, I have to hang up now.

405
01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:02.230
And this work is not meaningless.

406
01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:54.630
Water.

407
01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.880
Give me water.

408
01:23:37.340 --> 01:23:41.140
Do you remember the time when we first met each other?

409
01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.020
We wanted to organize a terrorist group and flip the world upside down.

410
01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.250
I miss those days.

411
01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:56.810
We got nothing to be afraid of.

412
01:23:57.140 --> 01:24:00.710
...Talk about this crap later when your mom dies,
just give me a cigar now.

413
01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:38.290
He must be related to one of the dead girls' families.

414
01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:40.520
Who the hell would do that, if he's not?

415
01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:49.320
He's joined our club, too.

416
01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:53.820
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

417
01:24:55.980 --> 01:25:01.000
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

418
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.990
He's playing the hunting game now.

419
01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:12.730
It looks like you got caught really bad this time.

420
01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.430
This guy went crazy after losing his bitch.

421
01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.700
Monster appeared.

422
01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:27.720
It's funny.

423
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.610
Go to bed, you must be tired now.

424
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:49.420
There are a lot of vacant rooms.

425
01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:51.770
You can sleep in any room.

426
01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:58.430
And I will prepare breakfast for tomorrow.

427
01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.300
Fucking assholes.

428
01:26:52.700 --> 01:26:55.200
Let go. Let go of me!

429
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:09.660
Fuck you, asshole.

430
01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.790
Shit, you guys are fucking crazy.

431
01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.670
Little bit more, little bit more.

432
01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:11.050
One more time.

433
01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.840
He's enjoying it--the same way you feel excited
when you're on the hunt.

434
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:04.860
Catch it, and release it; catch it, and release it.

435
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:07.180
He's enjoying seeing his prey in pain.

436
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:10.490
He's playing the hunting game now.

437
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.780
It's going to be even more terrible.

438
01:29:27.300 --> 01:29:29.500
It's fun.

439
01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:49.490
Don't do that.

440
01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:52.170
Didn't you see Mi-yeon last night?

441
01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:58.320
If you resist, it's more painful and takes longer.

442
01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.650
It'll be done quickly.

443
01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:06.940
So bear with me for a little bit.

444
01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:13.590
Then why did you suspect us? Huh?

445
01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:17.090
Did we ask for a house or money?

446
01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.430
We just wanted to stay here for few days, so why'd you guys give us shit!

447
01:31:20.850 --> 01:31:24.840
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

448
01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:34.580
You should've said that earlier. Huh!

449
01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:43.510
You retards always do that after shit happens.

450
01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:48.560
Wait, wait, the order is arms, legs, and head. Right?

451
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:52.960
Close your eyes. It's better not to see it.

452
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.770
Where is she?

453
01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:08.460
How did you come inside without making any noise?

454
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.450
I have a baby in my belly.

455
01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.840
I was curious how you'd look.

456
01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.250
I see you don't look like a monster.

457
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.780
Crazy asshole.

458
01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.540
The order is arms, legs and head. Right?

459
01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.100
I'll do exactly the same as how you guys did.

460
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:18.010
Don't worry about it, I won't do any more than that.

461
01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:21.960
You crazy psycho fuckers.

462
01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.430
I am actually relieved right now.

463
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:39.060
I was worried that something might've happened to you.

464
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.080
He's Kim Soo-hyun from NIS (National Intelligence Service), right?

465
01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.880
Do you want to see what he's been up to?

466
01:41:54.850 --> 01:41:56.500
Please make him stop.

467
01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:00.170
You can't become a monster to fight against a monster.

468
01:42:03.450 --> 01:42:06.220
You're worried about him too, right?

469
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:10.030
Where is he now?

470
01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:13.670
You should be okay since I treated you immediately.

471
01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:21.870
You know you both slept for 2 days straight?

472
01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.460
What happened?

473
01:42:28.350 --> 01:42:33.280
Why don't you just hand him over to the police?

474
01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:37.830
Not yet.

475
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:39.870
What are you gonna do?

476
01:42:41.850 --> 01:42:49.430
Do you know how it feels to have a huge lump in your chest?

477
01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.710
That feeling...

478
01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:58.680
I promised something to Joo-yeon.

479
01:42:58.850 --> 01:43:03.390
I will pay back what he's done.

480
01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:07.590
Not yet.

481
01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:12.940
It's still far from the end.

482
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:18.450
Alright. I won't ask you any more.

483
01:43:18.850 --> 01:43:23.800
By the way, the capsule's really good, right? Unless he has constipation...

484
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:33.650
He was knocked out after I gave him one strong shot.

485
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:37.200
I don't think he'll wake up until tomorrow.

486
01:43:44.850 --> 01:43:49.770
Soo-hyun, you know you look so different now?

487
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:25.760
Hello.

488
01:45:25.890 --> 01:45:28.350
Can I have a painkiller with Dexibuprofen in it?

489
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:31.500
What? Dexi- what?

490
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:32.900
Give me the strongest one.

491
01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:34.310
Okay.

492
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:39.250
Where are you now?

493
01:45:39.450 --> 01:45:41.250
It looks like you're not around.

494
01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:46.500
Hey, are you listening? Of course you are.

495
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:50.270
This is really fun! Huh!?

496
01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:55.130
I've never had this kind of fun before, my whole life.

497
01:45:57.250 --> 01:46:00.790
Hey... I know who you are.

498
01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:06.540
Your girlfriend was Jang Joo-yeon, lived in Yeonyi county. Right?

499
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:09.840
Am I correct?

500
01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.990
I want you to know that you made a mistake.

501
01:46:14.850 --> 01:46:17.050
You underestimated me.

502
01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:20.740
You'll regret that you didn't kill me when you had a chance.

503
01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.090
It doesn't even take much time to kill someone.

504
01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:24.090
Hello?

505
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:29.630
You'll see. I'll teach you how pain really feels.

506
01:46:31.250 --> 01:46:34.480
Hey, excuse me!

507
01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:47.200
By the way, before I killed her, she told me that she was pregnant

508
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:50.500
and begged for her life.

509
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:55.250
Did you know that?

510
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.960
Hu, hu, hu, hu, hurry up you asshole.

511
01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.100
Otherwise, that woman will die.

512
01:47:09.850 --> 01:47:13.480
You should've been around me, since you let me stay alive.

513
01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:59.100
Jang Gyeong-chul. Where did you go?

514
01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:27.020
Shit, do we have to do this to save them?

515
01:50:28.300 --> 01:50:32.900
Sometimes when I look at assholes like them, I don't want to be a human.

516
01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.060
Call me when they wake up.

517
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.310
What is this again?

518
01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:48.010
So what?

519
01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:55.470
Really? Is that for real?

520
01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600
I got it.

521
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.710
Hey, Jang Gyeong-chul is turning himself in.

522
01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:08.470
You son of a bitch, you made a mistake.

523
01:52:01.500 --> 01:52:03.600
Wake up.

524
01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:16.560
I want to ask you something.

525
01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:20.990
Where would your friend go?

526
01:52:32.250 --> 01:52:37.690
You shouldn't have got on his nerves.

527
01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.790
He pays back what he gets.

528
01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:48.340
Do you know what I mean?

529
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:56.350
Your girl, your girl's family, huh?

530
01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:05.710
After that, if he turns himself in, it's all done.

531
01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.190
But your girl must've not felt so bad.

532
01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:24.500
Unlike me, he gives pleasure before he gives pain.

533
01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.250
He gives pleasure first.

534
01:53:33.700 --> 01:53:38.780
Funny? Is that really funny?

535
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:43.040
That really makes you smile?

536
01:53:51.800 --> 01:53:57.840
Alright, I'll make you smile for the rest of your life.

537
01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.900
I wiretapped a call from Jang Gyeong-chul.

538
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:09.640
I was wiretapping the police communication because I was worried about you.

539
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:13.460
Just a few moments ago, Jang Gyeong-chul called the police,
saying he wants to turn himself in.

540
01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:16.830
But before he does that, he said he wants to finish some business.

541
01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.490
Is he gonna do it again?

542
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:20.940
What location did you wiretap the call from?

543
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:22.800
Yeonyi County.

544
01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.180
Detective Joh?

545
01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:15.170
This is Kim Soo-hyun.

546
01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.830
What?

547
01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:20.680
Why did you make things worse and let this happen?

548
01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:26.920
You're a dead man if anything happens to him. Got it!?

549
01:55:27.450 --> 01:55:29.830
Fucking answer me!

550
01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:40.000
Tell the other teams to go to Detective Jang's place, and turn the car around. Hurry up!

551
01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.650
Look alike?

552
01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.450
No.

553
01:57:43.450 --> 01:57:46.910
Joo-yeon must take after her mom.

554
01:57:47.800 --> 01:57:51.380
Thank god she doesn't take after her dad.

555
01:57:55.450 --> 01:57:58.890
Then why did you charge toward me like crazy?

556
01:57:58.900 --> 01:58:01.790
Are you crazy? Crazy?

557
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.100
Let me see.

558
01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:09.970
Shit, where is it?

559
01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:15.340
What would make that motherfucker get angry?

560
01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:18.130
Would he get mad if I do this?

561
01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:22.750
Like this? Like this? Like this?

562
01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:30.210
Like this, crazy motherfucker,
like this, you son of a bitch.

563
01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:28.780
Dad, I'm home.

564
02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:27.690
You can't come inside here.

565
02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:29.780
You can't.

566
02:00:39.200 --> 02:00:40.980
What is it?

567
02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.070
Let go of him.

568
02:00:44.600 --> 02:00:48.570
Are you Kim Soo-hyun?

569
02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:54.300
You bastard!

570
02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.490
Come over here!

571
02:00:55.500 --> 02:01:00.490
Do you have any idea what you've done? How dare you show up here!

572
02:01:00.500 --> 02:01:03.190
You worthless, crazy...

573
02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:06.800
Let go. Let go of me.

574
02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:14.000
What a ruthless bastard.

575
02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:18.690
Stay out of the way.

576
02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:20.770
Out of the way.

577
02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.790
Hello?

578
02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:07.000
This is Jang Gyeong-chul.

579
02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:10.210
You bastard.

580
02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.850
Where are you now?

581
02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:18.490
You, you didn't do anything to Sae-yeon. Right?

582
02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.420
You can find out later.

583
02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.610
What?

584
02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:37.600
Here.

585
02:03:53.550 --> 02:03:54.750
Hello.

586
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.430
How do you feel? Can you feel it now?

587
02:04:07.900 --> 02:04:13.270
Why did you fucking start chasing me, you ignorant fucking asshole.

588
02:04:13.900 --> 02:04:15.880
Who do you think won?

589
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:20.070
You, or me?

590
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:49.450
Jang Gyeong-chul, Jang Gyeong-chul!

591
02:05:49.970 --> 02:05:52.060
Jang Gyeong-chul showed up!

592
02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:54.840
Wait for my command.

593
02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.840
Now!

594
02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.830
Hurry up!

595
02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.440
Stop that car! Stop it!

596
02:07:14.800 --> 02:07:16.130
Catch him!

597
02:07:26.300 --> 02:07:28.250
Catch him! Catch him!

598
02:07:33.700 --> 02:07:35.670
Hey!

599
02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:50.030
Yes, you're right.

600
02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:54.550
I was wrong.

601
02:09:00.850 --> 02:09:04.360
I underestimated you.

602
02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:21.880
From now on, I won't go easy on you.

603
02:09:27.950 --> 02:09:29.720
You son of a bitch, what are you doing?

604
02:09:29.850 --> 02:09:34.150
What are you doing?

605
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:36.590
It's just the beginning.

606
02:09:36.600 --> 02:09:38.880
Why cry like a baby already?

607
02:09:41.410 --> 02:09:43.780
You son of a bitch.

608
02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.960
Son of a bitch, kill me already.

609
02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:49.050
Kill me already, son of a bitch.

610
02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.140
Kill me now, bitch!

611
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:54.550
Son of a bitch. Kill me already.

612
02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.340
Kill me already, son of a bitch. Kill me already!

613
02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.690
No. Not yet. Wait more.

614
02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:20.070
Think about it. If I were going to kill you, I would've already killed you before.

615
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.140
I'll kill you when you are in the most pain.

616
02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:35.080
When you're in the most pain, shivering out of fear--
then, I will kill you.

617
02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:47.770
That's a real revenge.
A real, complete revenge.

618
02:10:56.700 --> 02:10:59.990
Spare, spare my life.

619
02:11:00.600 --> 02:11:10.060
Spare, spare, spare, spare my life.

620
02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:23.990
You heard that a lot, right? "Spare my life."

621
02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.550
You must've enjoyed hearing that a lot.

622
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:36.590
Spare my life. Spare my life.

623
02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:49.130
I'll get punished.

624
02:11:51.500 --> 02:12:02.560
So, so spare my life, I've already had enough.

625
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.840
Since I've already had enough, stop it.

626
02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.520
Please, please spare my life.

627
02:12:31.450 --> 02:12:37.630
I'm really sorry.

628
02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.200
Please, please spare my life.

629
02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:15.820
Are you scared?

630
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:23.140
Tell me, now. Are you scared?

631
02:13:26.450 --> 02:13:34.040
Do you realize what you did now?

632
02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:04.300
You've played with me enough,
so stop it, son of a bitch.

633
02:14:08.500 --> 02:14:14.720
Hey...stop talking bullshit now.

634
02:14:17.200 --> 02:14:22.240
You lost already.

635
02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:28.210
You think you've played with me till now.

636
02:14:30.600 --> 02:14:33.700
Bullshit.

637
02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:46.700
I don't know what pain is.
Fear? Don't know that either.

638
02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:54.700
There's nothing you can get out of me.

639
02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:10.050
So...you already lost.

640
02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:13.440
You know that?

641
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:50.650
I wish you'd still feel pain after you die.

642
02:17:36.300 --> 02:17:37.950
Son of a bitch!

643
02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:41.950
Fucking asshole, you're dead!

644
02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.590
Crazy bitch! I'll stay alive. I'll fucking stay alive.

645
02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:49.900
You son of a bitch, I will stay alive.

646
02:17:50.150 --> 02:17:53.000
Hey, crazy, can you hear me?

647
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:54.440
Are you listening to me?

648
02:17:54.450 --> 02:17:57.320
I am afraid of nothing.

649
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:05.380
You crazy bitch. You think I'm bullshitting, right?

650
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:17.310
Dad. Dad.

651
02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:25.950
Hey. Hey! Don't open the door!

652
02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.770
Dad!

653
02:18:31.330 --> 02:18:35.500
No, no, don't open the door!

654
02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.950
Sang-hoon! Don't open the door.

655
02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:43.850
What the hell is he doing over there? Stay out of it.

656
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.300
Don't open the door!

657
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:50.990
How come it's not opening?

658
02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:55.050
No, no, fuck, why did you come here!?

659
02:18:55.800 --> 02:18:56.890
Mom.

660
02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:58.450
Are you in there?
